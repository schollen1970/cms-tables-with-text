<p><span><span>Available sizes (Series ED &amp; ET): 1”, 1½”, 2”, 2½”, 3”, 4”, 6” and 8”;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Available sizes (Series EZ): 1”, 1½” and 2”, 2½”, 3" and 4";</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>There are three styles of
valves available:</span></span><span><span>﻿</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Series ED valves are intended for general control
applications over a wide variety of temperature and pressure drops.</span></li>
<li><span><span>Series ET valves are intended for
applications requiring low leakage rates with composition seating (TFE) for tight shutoff requirements or metal-to-metal seating for higher temperature capabilities. The valve plug has a two-piece
upper seal.</span></span></li>
<li><span><span>Series EZ valves are globe style with
integral end connections, post guiding, and quick-change trim. These valves are used in chemical or hydrocarbon processing applications or in applications that require control of non-lubricating,
viscous, or other hard-to-handle fluids.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span><span>The flow direction for standard cages is flow down, and the flow direction for the Series EZ is up through the seat ring, with the following flow characteristics available:
linear, quick-opening, and equal percent.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The end connections available are ANSI Class 150, 300 and 600 Raised Face or Ring Type Joint flanges as per ASME B16.34-1996.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Valve bodies are available in LCC, WCB (carbon steel) and 316 stainless steel materials.</span></span></p>
